<!--Implementing Headings in HTML-->
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p> This section is going to address the way in which you mark up text.
Almost every document you create will contain some form of text, so this
will be a very important section. </p>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<p> Before you start to mark up your text, it is best to understand what
XHTML does when it comes across spaces and how browsers treat long sentences
and paragraphs of text. </p>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<p> No matter what sort of document you are creating, most documents have
headings in some form or other... </p> 
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<P>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Modi, velit nulla illo quae sunt laboriosam maiores assumenda praesentium sit nam!</P>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quidem, eius?</p>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Culpa beatae minima ratione ipsa, fugiat neque!</p>
